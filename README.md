## Owning the problem
To successfully manage an escalation, you need to own the problem.

Nine Keys to "owning" the escalation
1. Shut up and listen  Sometimes listening defuses the issue.  Don't make execuses.  Don't make promises.  Acknowledge the issue.  
2. Be available
3. Avoid the blame game.  Dont' blame anyone.  Focus on getting the issue addressed. Focus on mitigation, next resolution and the get to root cause
4. Demonstrate that you are committed
5. Be honest early and often.  Focus on what you can do
6. Have a plan.  Give customer confidence that you have a plan and working the issue
7. Avoid esclating to leadership simplely becuase a customer requests it.
8. Brief your leadership.
9. Communicate.  provide updates as you work the issue and set expectations appropriately

## Internal Escalation Management
1. Don't be afraid to ask for help.  A great CSM doens't have to have all the answers but no how to get them.  Use the 15 minute rule if you can't find an ansswer in 15 minutes then you need to go ask for help.  Ask for help early.
2. You are one company.  The better you work collaborately, the less need there will be to escalate.
3. Maximize impact by avoiding email.  Good for intial interaction or summary. Not ideal for resolving issues and it add times to the resolution.
4. When depending on others be realistic.  Always pad estimates from others that you have little to no influence over.
5. Always have a backup plan.  Always have a plan b.
6. Make sure commitements are specific and put them in writing.  WHen depending on others get specific dates or date ranges they are commiting to deliver.  Send an email laying out the commitment and dates expected.

## Expectation Management
This is the most underrated customer success skill.  It's also the moust underused skill.  People who practice goode epxectation managment know how to communicate, organize and direct conversations and people around getting things done.


Expectation Management Techniques
1. Don't make assumptions.  Don't assume you understand the problem or forumalate a response untily you've talked to everyone
2. Communicate early and often
3. Be proactive and transparent
4. Push back.  Be confident that the expectation is realistic and acheivable.  Don't tell the customer what they want to hear, tell them what you can do.
5. Under-promise and over-deliver
